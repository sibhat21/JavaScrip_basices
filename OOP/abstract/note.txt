OOP: whih is a programming paradim(style) and which centerd around Objects rather than functions
OOP:which is not a programming language but programming paradim

4 pillars(core concept of OOP) are:
  a)Encapsulation:a grouping of a related variables and function are opperated them in an object
     // it simply grouping  a related variables and function together 
     benefites
      # reduce code  complexity
      # increase code reuseability 


         
b) Abstraction:hiding the details and complexity but shows the essentials part of the code 
   ## reduce complexity
   ## isolate impact of change  


 c) Inherentace:a technique of eliminating  redundent code
  d) polymorphism:refactor ugly switch/case statments
